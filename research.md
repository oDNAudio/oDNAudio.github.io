## Work in Progress

***Mapping Mining Areas in the Tropics from 2016–2024*** with Philipp Sepin and [Nikolas Kuschnig](https://www.kuschnig.eu/). *Under Review*. [WP (pdf)](files/wp_mapping-mines-tropics_SVK.pdf)

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mining provides crucial materials for the global economy and the climate transition, but has potentially severe adverse environmental and social impacts. Currently, the analysis of such impacts is obstructed by the poor availability of data on mining activity — particularly in regions most affected. In this paper, we present a novel panel dataset of mining areas in the tropical belt from 2016 to 2024. We use a transformer-based segmentation model, trained on an extensive dataset of mining polygons from the literature, to automatically delineate mining areas in satellite imagery over time. The resulting dataset features improved accuracy and reduced noise from human errors, and can readily be extended to cover new locations and points in time as they become available. Our comprehensive dataset of mining areas can be used to assess local environmental, social, and economic impacts of mining activity in regions where conventional data is not available or incomplete.

***Mines–Rivers–Yields: Downstream Mining Impacts on Agriculture in Africa*** with Gustav Pirich, [Maximilian Heinze](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/economics/people/maximilian-h) and [Nikolas Kuschnig](https://www.kuschnig.eu/). *Under Review*. [WP (pdf)](files/wp_mines-rivers-yields_VPHK.pdf)

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  Minerals are essential to fuel the green transition, can foster local employment and facilitate economic development. But their extraction is also linked to several negative social and environmental externalities. Our understanding of these adverse impacts is especially limited in low-income countries, undermining our ability to manage them. In this paper, we use remotely sensed data to shine a light on the impacts of mine runoffs on agricultural yields in Africa. We use a discontinuity from mine locations along river basins to identify the causal effect that is mediated by water. Both agricultural yields and vegetation health in general are reduced considerably downstream of mines. Effects are economically significant and dissipate after about 100 kilometers, suggesting sediment as a possible cause. Our findings underscore an urgent need to better address polluting industries in a development context to limit their negative externalities for agriculture.

***Eroding Resilience of Deforestation Interventions — Evidence from Brazil’s Lost Decade.*** Kuschnig, N., Vashold, L., Soterroni, A., and Obersteiner, M. (2023). *Environmental Research Letters*, 18(7):074039. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/acdfe7)

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
   Brazil once set the example for curtailing deforestation with command and control policies, but, in the last decade, these interventions have gone astray. Environmental research and policy today are largely informed by the earlier successes of deforestation interventions, but not their recent failures. Here, we investigate the resilience of deforestation interventions. We discuss how the recent trend reversal in Brazil came to be, and what its implications for the design of future policies are. We use newly compiled information on environmental fines in an econometric model to show that the enforcement of environmental policy has become ineffective in recent years. Our results add empirical evidence to earlier studies documenting the erosion of the institutions responsible for forest protection, and highlight the considerable deforestation impacts of this erosion. Future efforts for sustainable forest protection should be aimed at strengthening institutions, spreading responsibilities, and redistributing the common value of forests via incentive-based systems.

***The Economic Impacts of Malaria: Past, Present, Future.*** Kuschnig, N. and Vashold, L. (2023). In: *Planetary Health Approaches to Understand and Control Vector-borne Diseases*, Wageningen Academic. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3920/9789004688650_008), [WP]()

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
   Malaria places a great burden on the health and prosperity of many and occupies a great number of scientists and policymakers. The dynamics of the disease are tightly interwoven with economics — incidence is both tied to economic circumstances and impacts them. Economic research plays an important role in understanding and supporting the fight against malaria. The economic literature, however, features a number of peculiarities that can hamper accessibility and has been slow to approach interdisciplinary issues. In this chapter, we explain the economic perspective and summarise the literature on the economic impacts of malaria. Malaria has severe impacts on individual and aggregate economic outcomes, including mortality and morbidity, but also indirect burdens that materialise with a delay. The fight against malaria is not an economic policy per se, but may provide beneficial economic spillovers and can be vital in establishing an environment that allows for prosperity. Economic insights can make a difference in the design and implementation of effective and efficient eradication and control strategies. This is critical in the light of increasing disease (re-)exposure due to climate change and the emergence of resistant vectors and pathogens.
