***Man Eats Forest: Impacts of Cattle Ranching on Amazon Deforestation.*** with [Nikolas Kuschnig](https://www.kuschnig.eu/). [Slides (pdf)](files/slides_cattle-deforestation-amazon_KV.pdf)
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p align="justify">Demand for agricultural products is a major driver of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. However, the extent of their deforestation impact is contested, as deforested land is relatively unproductive, and many products are barred from agriculture supply chains. In this paper, we quantify the deforestation impacts of expanding agricultural production, differentiating it from other channels with different implications for economic and environmental policy. We use a shift-share design, exploiting international changes in beef consumption to causally identify the deforestation impact of agricultural demand. We find that pasture and cattle herd expansions are major direct drivers of deforestation. Their direct impacts diminished during the recent deforestation boom, suggesting that land speculation motives have become more important. Our findings indicate that intensification and improved land tenure security could help decrease land pressure, but also highlight that deforestation interventions need to target the dominant role of agricultural production. </p>

***Mapping Mining Areas in the Tropics from 2016–2024*** with Philipp Sepin and [Nikolas Kuschnig](https://www.kuschnig.eu/). *Under Review*. [WP (pdf)](files/wp_mapping-mines-tropics_SVK.pdf)
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p align="justify">Mining provides crucial materials for the global economy and the climate transition, but has potentially severe adverse environmental and social impacts. Currently, the analysis of such impacts is obstructed by the poor availability of data on mining activity — particularly in regions most affected. In this paper, we present a novel panel dataset of mining areas in the tropical belt from 2016 to 2024. We use a transformer-based segmentation model, trained on an extensive dataset of mining polygons from the literature, to automatically delineate mining areas in satellite imagery over time. The resulting dataset features improved accuracy and reduced noise from human errors, and can readily be extended to cover new locations and points in time as they become available. Our comprehensive dataset of mining areas can be used to assess local environmental, social, and economic impacts of mining activity in regions where conventional data is not available or incomplete. </p>

***Mines–Rivers–Yields: Downstream Mining Impacts on Agriculture in Africa*** with Gustav Pirich, [Maximilian Heinze](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/economics/people/maximilian-h) and [Nikolas Kuschnig](https://www.kuschnig.eu/). *Under Review*. [WP (pdf)](files/wp_mines-rivers-yields_VPHK.pdf)
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p align="justify">Minerals are essential to fuel the green transition, can foster local employment and facilitate economic development. But their extraction is also linked to several negative social and environmental externalities. Our understanding of these adverse impacts is especially limited in low-income countries, undermining our ability to manage them. In this paper, we use remotely sensed data to shine a light on the impacts of mine runoffs on agricultural yields in Africa. We use a discontinuity from mine locations along river basins to identify the causal effect that is mediated by water. Both agricultural yields and vegetation health in general are reduced considerably downstream of mines. Effects are economically significant and dissipate after about 100 kilometers, suggesting sediment as a possible cause. Our findings underscore an urgent need to better address polluting industries in a development context to limit their negative externalities for agriculture.</p>

***The Saturated Bayesian: A Probabilistic Break Detection Framework***, with Lucas D Konrad and Jes&#250;s Crespo Cuaresma.
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p align="justify">Effectively tackling contemporary challenges posed by climate change and the continued degradation of natural habitats requires swift and decisive actions. Identifying the most effective policies (or a mix thereof) is crucial to inform policy-makers that are often constrained in their choice set. Traditional methods for policy evaluation rely on precise knowledge about the occurrence and timing of interventions. Structural break identification on the other hand has a long tradition in the field of econometrics. Recent approaches cast the search for such breaks in the form of indicator-saturated regressions, identifying step-shifts in relevant time series, but lack a proper framework of uncertainty quantification. We introduce a coherent probabilistic framework for the detection of structural breaks with unknown timing in panel data. The proposed Bayesian setup naturally incorporates the quantification of break uncertainty with little overhead. Simulation studies demonstrate that our approach is competitive to existing approaches in detecting true positives and drastically reduces false positives. We apply our method to replicate studies on the effectiveness of climate policies in the European transport sector and provide novel insights in the dynamics of deforestation in the tropics.</p>

***The heterogeneous effects of macroprudential policies in Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe***, Master thesis, *R&R at Economic Modelling*. [WP (pdf)](files/wp_macropru-heterogneity-cesee_V.pdf)
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p align="justify">The effects of macroprudential policy (MPP) are of great interest to policy-makers, given their goal to maintain financial stability and safeguarding the broader macroeconomic environment. Structural characteristics of countries likely mediate these effects, but there is a lack of empirical evidence about the heterogeneous effects of MPPs. We study the dynamic responses to a tightening macroprudential shock for countries in Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe (CESEE), a region that experienced periods of pronounced macrofinancial boom-bust cycles and adopted MPPs comparatively early. We employ a hierarchical Bayesian panel vector autoregressive model to allow for joint analysis of multiple economies while explicitly acknowledging heterogeneities across them. We find that MPPs are effective in curbing credit growth and reduced capital inflows in CESEE. However, responses differ considerably across countries, especially for cross-border capital flows. We investigate the impact of structural characteristics and find that the exchange rate regime, the level of financial development, and the external openness of countries play key roles in shaping the effects of MPPs.</p>

***Eroding Resilience of Deforestation Interventions — Evidence from Brazil’s Lost Decade.*** Kuschnig, N., Vashold, L., Soterroni, A., and Obersteiner, M. (2023). *Environmental Research Letters*, 18(7):074039. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/acdfe7)
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
   <p align="justify">Brazil once set the example for curtailing deforestation with command and control policies, but, in the last decade, these interventions have gone astray. Environmental research and policy today are largely informed by the earlier successes of deforestation interventions, but not their recent failures. Here, we investigate the resilience of deforestation interventions. We discuss how the recent trend reversal in Brazil came to be, and what its implications for the design of future policies are. We use newly compiled information on environmental fines in an econometric model to show that the enforcement of environmental policy has become ineffective in recent years. Our results add empirical evidence to earlier studies documenting the erosion of the institutions responsible for forest protection, and highlight the considerable deforestation impacts of this erosion. Future efforts for sustainable forest protection should be aimed at strengthening institutions, spreading responsibilities, and redistributing the common value of forests via incentive-based systems.</p>

***The Economic Impacts of Malaria: Past, Present, Future.*** Kuschnig, N. and Vashold, L. (2023). In: *Planetary Health Approaches to Understand and Control Vector-borne Diseases*, Wageningen Academic. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3920/9789004688650_008), [WP (pdf)](files/wp_malaria-impacts_KV.pdf)
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
   <p align="justify">Malaria places a great burden on the health and prosperity of many and occupies a great number of scientists and policymakers. The dynamics of the disease are tightly interwoven with economics — incidence is both tied to economic circumstances and impacts them. Economic research plays an important role in understanding and supporting the fight against malaria. The economic literature, however, features a number of peculiarities that can hamper accessibility and has been slow to approach interdisciplinary issues. In this chapter, we explain the economic perspective and summarise the literature on the economic impacts of malaria. Malaria has severe impacts on individual and aggregate economic outcomes, including mortality and morbidity, but also indirect burdens that materialise with a delay. The fight against malaria is not an economic policy per se, but may provide beneficial economic spillovers and can be vital in establishing an environment that allows for prosperity. Economic insights can make a difference in the design and implementation of effective and efficient eradication and control strategies. This is critical in the light of increasing disease (re-)exposure due to climate change and the emergence of resistant vectors and pathogens.</p>
