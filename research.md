## Work in progress

  - Lastes version available [here](https://research.wu.ac.at/ws/portalfiles/portal/44832243/WP340.pdf)
  - We investigate the effects of large technology acquisitions on venture capital investment and innovation in relevant markets covering the universe of all Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft acquisitions. We find strong negative effects on venture capital investment but heterogeneous effects on innovation.

- ***Evaluating Tampon Tax Reforms using Transaction Based Scanner Data*** (with [Klara Kinnl](https://sites.google.com/view/klarakinnl), ongoing work)

  - *A preliminary version of this paper was presented at the European Parliament's [FEMM committee workshop](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/de/product/product-details/20221202WKS04761) on 08/12/2022.*
  
  - In this project we evaluate the causal impact of various tax reductions for mentrual hygiene products on prices as well as quantities purchased. We find close to full pass-through but muted effects on quantities purchased. 

  - We find that the tax reduction translates into prices dynamically over a period of at least 12 months.
