## Work in progress

* Evaluating Tampon Tax Reforms using Transaction Based Scanner Data (Together with Klara Kinnl, ongoing work)

In this project we evaluate the causal impact of various tax reductions for mentrual hygiene products on prices as well as quantities purchased. We find close to full pass-through but muted effects on quantities purchased. 

A preliminary version of this paper was presented at the European Parliaments FEMM committee workshop on 08/12/2022.

* Big-tech M&A, Venture Capital and Innovation (Together with Klaus Gugler and Florian Sz√ºcs)

We investigate the effects of large technology acquisitions on venture capital investment and innovation in relevant markets covering the universe of all Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft acquisitions. We find strong negative effects on venture capital investment but heterogeneous effects on innovation.
