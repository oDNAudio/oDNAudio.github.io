I am a **PhD candidate in Economics** at the Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU Wien). In my research I apply **econometric methods** to investigate **environmental issues**, including deforestation dynamics in the tropics, environmental impacts of mining and other industries, and the projection of greenhouse gas emissions as well as potentially effective mitigation strategies.

I am also **Data Lead** for the [World Emissions Clock](https://worldemissions.io/), an interactive webtool to inform on country- and sector-specific emissions and their potential future trajectories, developed by the **World Data Lab**.
