I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU Vienna). My research revolves around applying **econometric methods** to investigate **environmental** issues, including deforestation dynamics, environmental impacts of mining and other industries, and projecting greenhouse gas emissions.

<!-- I am also Senior Data Scientist at [World Data Lab](https://worlddata.io/), where I am the Data Lead for the [World Emissions Clock](https://worldemissions.io/). -->

I am currently visiting Rafael Araujo at **FGV-EESP** in S&#227;o Paulo until mid-December.
